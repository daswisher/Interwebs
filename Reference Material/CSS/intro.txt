CSS (Cascading style sheets) is a way to change the visual apperance of html pages. It works by selecting a specific attribute, and then provides the styling settings within a block of code.

Example:
We want to change the background color of elements of <p> along with its text color...

p {
	background-color: blue;
	color: yellow;
}

We can use css to change specific additional attributes as well. This is useful if we're trying to modify a link color as well as its color when it's being hovered over. In order to select he property of the elemnt, we use a colon after the element followed by the property.

Example:

a {
	color: black;
}

a:hover {
	color: white;
}

Some other things we can change on a link are the following...
a:link <<<Unvisited link
a:visited <<<Visited link
a:hover <<<When mouse hovers over link
a:active  <<<When the link is clicked
