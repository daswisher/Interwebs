DOM:
Also known as Document Object Model, is a way to represent the structural hierarchy of elements within an html document. Simply, it's a tree diagram that demonstrates element nesting. The element that is being looked at is what is selected. The element that the selected item is in, is the parent. Any elements that the selected element contains are known as child elements. Elements that are children of the same parent are known as siblings.


File inclusion:

In order to access files to include it within the webpage, you can use files that are within the directory, in a directory within the working directory, or up a level of the working directory. 
>Working directory
Simply reference the file name itself
>Directory within the working directory
folderName/filename.extension
>Up a directory
../filename.extension
>Up a directory and in a different directory
../folderName/filename.extension
***If there is a space in the file/directory name, there doesn't need to be a special character to designate the space (i.e: if we had a directory in root called "this directory" would be ../this directory/filename.extension)***
