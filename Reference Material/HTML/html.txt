File inclusion:

In order to access files to include it within the webpage, you can use files that are within the directory, in a directory within the working directory, or up a level of the working directory. 
>Working directory
Simply reference the file name itself
>Directory within the working directory
folderName/filename.extension
>Up a directory
../filename.extension
>Up a directory and in a different directory
../folderName/filename.extension
***If there is a space in the file/directory name, there doesn't need to be a special character to designate the space (i.e: if we had a directory in root called "this directory" would be ../this directory/filename.extension)***
