When creating websites, make sure to separate the header and footer links.

Header <<< Should be site navigation links

Footer <<< Support links for website and business.
>Footer is usually divided into two parts (the top/main and the bottom)
>>Footer top <<< Has quick links to resources
>>Footer bottom <<< Has links about privacy, copyright, terms of use
